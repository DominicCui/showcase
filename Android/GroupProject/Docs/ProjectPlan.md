**Author**: Team 064 <br>
**Version**: 2.0 (Final Results)
 

## 1 Introduction

Team 064 is developing an application for a user to track and compare job offers in an Android application. This application can also compare job offers to a user's current job, if applicable, in fields such as salary, cost of living, and number of shares.
 

## 2 Process Description

 

| Activity  | Description | Entrance Criteria | Exit Criteria |
|--|--|--|--|
| Analysis | Review requirements and discuss internally common assumptions. Identify classes, attributes, and operations. Talk through relationships between requirement artifacts. | Textual description of requirements. | Documented internal discussions of requirements and assumptions. |
| Design | Generate documentation of anticipated application design from requirements. Capture class diagram, UI mockups, test plan, and use case models. Take team confidence levels in design approach and address concerns. | Common understanding of requirements between team. | Class diagram, UI mockups, test plan, and use case models documented. Also, team concurrence on design artifacts. |
| Implementation | Develop the implementation described in the design documents. Hold planning sessions to detail out work. Assign time frames and developers to planned work. Execute tasks to developers best confidence along with unit tests passing. | Design documents complete. | Minimum 80% unit test code coverage and all planned work complete.  |
| Test | Create system level tests. System level tests may be either in code or in a step-by-step process a user (or developer) will walk through and document results. | System level test plans. Completion of coding tasks. | All system level test results passing and documented.  |
| Deployment | Deploy application to target hardware emulator and run system level tests. No errors or warnings shall be seen from the deployment to Android hardware. Team will vote on successful deployment. | Completed implementation and passing unit and system level tests. | System level test runs properly on target hardware emulator. Team is in concurrence with successful deployment. |
